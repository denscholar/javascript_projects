/* 

in javascript every value is an object or primitive. 

object DATATYPE
 let me = {
    name: 'jonas';
 }

 PRIMITIVE
 let firstName = 'John';

 There are seven datatype
 1. Numbers: floatiing points numbers = > used for decimals and integers
 2. string = sequesce of characters and used for text and always inside a quote
 3. Boolean => logical datatype and will always be in for of true or false
 4. undefined => value taken by a variable thats not yet defined (empty value) e.g let children;
 5. null => means empty values
 6. symbol => this defines a value that is unique and cannot be changed, not useful for us now
 7. bigint => laarger integers than the Number types can hold

Javascript has a dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the datatype of the value in a variable. Instead, types are defined or determined automatically. though is is not true in many other programming languages. 

one good thing about dynamic typing iss that it can be reassigned in the future.

// COMMENTING:
In programming we use commenting to describe what the code is doing and the code being commented will be ignored and not executed.


*/

// BOOLEAN
let javascriptIsfun = true;
console.log(javascriptIsfun);


// TypeOF
// This is a special operator used to sshow the datatype of a variable of value.

console.log(typeof javascriptIsfun);
