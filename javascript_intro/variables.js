// conventions and rules for naming variables

// 1. CamelCase: firstName
// use camel case to name your variable. You can also use underscore but by convention camel case is reqquired

// 2. you variable cannot start with a number

// 3. avoid dusing javascript reserved keywords
// let new = 'Dennis';

// let name = 'Dennis'

// 4. do not start a variable name with an upper case letter. again this is convention.
// NB: variable that has all letters in uooercase is called constant.
