// Strict Mode In JavaScript

// What is JavaScript Strict Mode?
 

// As the name suggests, Strict Mode enforces some strict principles for a Javascript program; this means that the leverages given by JavaScript are not available while working in the strict mode.

// Working in the Strict Mode means that you cannot get away by writing a bad syntax code. JavaScript will avoid simple syntax errors and execute the code flawlessly if you are not working in strict mode.

// For instance, if you initialize a variable with some value without declaring the variable in the script, the JavaScript compiler will not throw an error and simply ignore it.

// To use JavaScript Strict Mode in your programs, you just have to include one line at the top of your script.

"use strict";
